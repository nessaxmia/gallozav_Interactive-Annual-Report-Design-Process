    <h2>Financial Results</h2>
    <p>For the full year ended December 31, 2022, our reported net sales increased 8.0% versus the prior year on positive price/mix across all regions partially offset by a modest decline in volume and foreign currency. Growth was led by Snacks across all four regions and consolidated net sales grew in cereal and noodles and other. Organic net sales increased 11.5% from the prior year after excluding the impact of foreign currency. </p>

     <p> Reported operating profit decreased 6.7% versus the prior year due primarily to unfavorable mark-to-market impacts, costs related to the Company's pending separation, and foreign currency, as well as economy-wide supply disruptions and input cost inflation that persisted throughout the year. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 7.0%, after excluding the impact of mark-to-market, separation costs, and foreign currency. </p>
        
      <p> Reported diluted EPS of $2.79 for the year decreased 35.6% compared to the prior year EPS of $4.33 due primarily to unfavorable mark-to-market and costs related to the Company's pending separation. Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $4.38 for the year increased 5.3% compared to prior year EPS of $4.16, after excluding the impact of significant items impacting comparability. </p>
